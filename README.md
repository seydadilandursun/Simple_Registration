# Simple_Registration
We will create a simple registration code  for a basic user authentication and registration system. Users can choose to either log in or sign up by entering 'L' or 'S' respectively. After entering a username and password, the program checks for successful login or registration, printing corresponding messages. If the user chooses to log out after a successful login, it prints a log-out message. The program utilizes a dictionary, list_of_users, to store user credentials. Error messages prompt users to try again when login or sign-up conditions are not met.
